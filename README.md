# Color-changing-grid2
A grid consisting of color changing tiles, made with javascript/html/css.

I decided to pick up an old assignment, change it up a little, and make a color changing grid in javascript. Once a tile is clicked, the surrounding tiles should change color in an animated way (i.e. ripple). It contains of dynamic DOM element addition, json objects, event listeners and basic positional awareness of the tiles.
